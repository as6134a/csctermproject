    <p class="paragraph">Peer 4 Peer is a tutoring web application that connects students to peers able to tutor them in a shared course. We have been truly blessed with some awesome tutors throughout our years of operation.  We are grateful to every one of them for their hearts, energies, and time they give these students as they instill their love for learning in their classrooms.  We have always made every effort to carefully select our tutors for every subject taught.  It is our desire to select tutors who bring an infectious love for their subject of expertise to the classroom, as well as having the necessary knowledge and the ability to relate with and teach our students.  We have never advertised for a tutor.</p>
