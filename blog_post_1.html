		<p>     At Peer 4 Peer, we firmly believe that tutoring should be catered to each student's needs, strengths, and personal goals. We acknowledge that formal education will not have an equal effect on each student and that for many, a supplemental method of learning may be necessary.
			<br>
			<br>
		Here are a few of the many things tutoring can offer that formal education cannot:
		<p>
			<strong>Differentiated Instruction:</strong>
			Differentiation is a critical component of any delivered instruction. One on one tutoring allows for tutors to differentiate instruction dependent on the skill level of the learner. This allows students of all different levels to have access to the same curricula as their peers are studying.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Individual Mentoring:</strong>
			Sometimes, an individual mentor can be the difference between an A and an F. One on one tutoring offers students the chance to connect with their tutor, who can personalize instruction by understanding their student on a one on one level. Also, mentoring may increase intrinsic motivation in the student.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Accomodating for learning differences</strong>
			Students who have learning differences strongly benefit from one on one tutoring plans. One on one tutors who are knowledgable about working with learning differences can offer these students more access to curricula and content than they would get inside a standard classroom. Plus, one on one tutoring allows these students to feel more supported and nurtured in their differences.
