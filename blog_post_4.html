		<p>It is with heavy hearts that we announce we will be closing up shop. This is the end of Peer 4 Peer. We had a nice run, but our time has come to an end. Our plans to expand to other schools are cancelled. We apologize to all students who were excited to learn. Signing off for the last time, Matt.</p>
