  <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">When we look into the future of our company, we see it in the reflection of our students' futures. Our mission is to provide students with an personalized approach to education, to not only supplement what they learn in the classroom, but to also open new educational avenues for them to wander. We do not want to regurgitate what they have been learning; rather, our mission is to approach their educational objectives from a different angle in order to guide them towards achieving that objective.</p>

    <h4>How did you come up with the concept for the company</h4>
    <p class="paragraph"> We saw the market open for a product like Peer 4 Peer. While many of us turn to the tutoring services available online and on campus, receiving help from someone who has taken the same class is superior. Furthermore, keeping the chaotic schedule of a college student in mind, we belive Peer 4 Peer will allow people to get help at any time.  </p>
