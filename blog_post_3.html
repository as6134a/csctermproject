		<p>After seeing such great success at AU, we have decided to expanding to other schools in the DC area. That includes George Washington University, Georgetown University, Catholic University, and University of DC. In the near future we can see ourselves growing into the rest of the DMV area. Big things are happening here at Peer 4 Peer. Get pumped.</p>
